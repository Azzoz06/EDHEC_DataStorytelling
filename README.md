# Data Storytelling
This repository contains all the needed information for the **Data Visualization and Storytelling** course.  
The objective of the course is to emphasize on principles, theory, processes and techniques used to build effective visuals helping students to choose the best way to show data, understand data and communicate with data. Practical application of data visualization will give students some of the foundations needed:
  * to present data using engaging and impactful visual design
  * to go deeper and grow additional skills in data visualization using other tools

## Course setup
For the Lab section of the course, students will use **IBM Watson Studio** which is an **IBM Cloud Service**.  
The tasks needed to setup your Lab environment are the following:
1. Create an **IBM Cloud** account ([instructions](./setup/ibm_cloud.md))
2. Create the **IBM Watson Studio** instance ([instructions](./setup/ibm_watson.md))
3. Load the needed data files into the project as Data Assets

## Course labs
Practical Hands-on experience will be provided during the Labs. List of Labs is available here, clicking on the link will direct you to the Labs instructions.
